    We've seen how images are made of <span class="highlight-pink">pixels</span>, 
    and their brightness forms an image...
  </p>
  <p class="question">
    But how do images show <span class="bold">colour</span>?
  </p>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p class="highlight-green">
      Colour images show <span class="highlight-red">three</span> images at once:
    </p>
    <p class="rgb-text">
      <span class="red">Red</span> +  
      <span class="green">Green</span> +  
      <span class="blue">Blue</span>
    </p>
    <p class="explanation">
      Each image tells us how much of that colour is in each pixel.
